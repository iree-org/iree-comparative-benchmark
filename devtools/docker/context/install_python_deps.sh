# Note that we use --ignore-installed when installing packages that may have
# been auto-installed by the OS package manager (i.e. PyYAML is often an
# implicit OS-level dep). This should not break so long as we do not
# subsequently reinstall it on the OS side. Failing to do this will yield a
# hard error with pip along the lines of:
#   Cannot uninstall 'PyYAML'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we
#   cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to
#   only a partial uninstall.
